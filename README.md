# Spatial Impact Study of a Public Works Program in India
This is some text. We are using Python 3.10 btw.

## Data Collection
The data has been sourced from the [India-WRIS](https://indiawris.gov.in/wris/#/groundWater) Ground Water Levels data
page. The collection has been automated with the help of Selenium.      
Soon(TM): add latitude and longitude data to the datasets being generated by Selenium.
